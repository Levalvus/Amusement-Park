This Java program creates several subclasses of theme park attractions that are all subclasses theme park class. While stats like RidersPerHour and Income are common among these classes, each specific subclass of ride holds their own unique stats to keep track of. Each of these rides are assigned to a theme park class, which can sort through the common elements of the subclasses to find statistics about the theme park as a whole. As this system is not constantly updated with real statistics, I used static placeholder numbers to demonstrate the abilities of the system.
